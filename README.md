There are 2 Models to be train. If one executes Model_trainer.py both should be trained. (I hope)

If this is not the case just execute Model_trainer2.py which will train the real time system.

Both programms need the same Datastructure.

To be able to run make a Folder named Pi_Pictures and 
insert the following dataset to it:

Example Datastructure:

->Model_trainer.py

->Model_trainer2.py

->Classification_model.py

->Classification_model2.py

->Dataset_generator.py

->Pi_Pictures

	->Train

		->Balls

		...

	->Test

		->Balls

		...
